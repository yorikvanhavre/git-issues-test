## Git-issues test

This repo is a simple experiment to test git-issues from https://github.com/duplys/git-issues

The general idea is that your issues are stored together with the code, in the repository itself. It also has compatibility with github issues, which is the main thing I want to test here.

## Install

### Linux

- Git clone the https://github.com/duplys/git-issues.git repo
- Make a symlink of **git-issues** to one of your exec paths, for ex. $USER/.local/bin
- Make a symlink of **gitshelve.py** either to the same dir as above, or to a python modules path

After that you can simply run **git issues** or **git-issues**
